# Advent of Code

My solutions to the Advent of Code problems in Haskell.

By the way, I basically don't know Haskell... I'm trying to get better at it.

## Set up

```
$ brew install ghc cabal-install
$ cabal update
$ cabal install split PureMD5 memoize
```

## Build and run

```
$ cd problemXX
$ make
$ ./partX [args]
```
