# Advent of Code

My solutions to the Advent of Code problems in Haskell (and for 2018 in Rust!).

By the way, I basically don't know Haskell... I'm trying to get better at it.
Same with Rust in 2018!

## Set up

```
$ brew install ghc cabal-install
$ cabal update
$ cabal install split PureMD5 memoize json vector
```

## Build and run

```
$ cd year/problemXX
$ make
$ ./partX [args]
```
